--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the Dungeon of Perpetual Code Bugs. Your mission is to end
the cycle of endless bugs by finding the four pillars of object oriented
programming. The four pillars, "Abstraction", "Encapsulation", "Inheritance",
and "Polymorphism", are scattered throughout the dungeon.

Finding all four objectives will be no easy feat. The maze is full of doors
that lead no where and rooms with hidden pits that can fall into. While there
are dangers in the maze, there also tools in the maze that can help you.
Health potions will repair damage done by pits and vision potions can help you
navigate the maze!

HOW TO PLAY

With each turn you will have the option to 1) Explore the maze,
2) Use a health potion, 3) Use a vision potion or 4) Check your status.

If you choose to explore the maze you will be asked which direction
(North, East, South, or West) you want to explore. If you find a new room,
any objects in the room will automatically be picked up. Likewise if you come
across a pit, you will fall in, destined to forever be trapped in a maze
of incomprehensible classes, and methods, and constructors (oh my!).

If you choose to use a health potion your health will increase by the
value of the potion and the potion will be removed from your inventory.
If you choose to use a vision potion you will be able to see part of the
dungeon around you.

To win the game you need to find all four pillars and make it to the dungeon's
exit with your health intact! If you run out of health or exit before finding
all four pillars you'll be stuck debugging poorly documented issues until the
end of time.
